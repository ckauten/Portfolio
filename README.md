# My Awesome Project

Welcome to my portfolio! This simple, static site highlights my work and shares a bit about me.

**Link to project:** http://cameronkauten.com/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript and just a little bit of sass

When building this site, my main focus was on accessibility, ensuring it's viewable on any device. The design is straightforward, featuring a dark mode/light mode toggle. It's built using flexbox and responsive design principles for optimal performance across all screen sizes.

## Lessons Learned:

Plan out darkmode/lightmode settings before getting very far commited into styling and colors! It would have been way easier to add the feature in early than backtrack.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
